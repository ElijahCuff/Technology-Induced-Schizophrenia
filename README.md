### V2K ( Voice to Skull )   
- Ultrasound Voice Transmission to Inner Ear Bones has proven effective at transmitting voice to the skull ( V2K ) at an average of 19500Hz

US Navy conducted several successful studies in 2003 that seem to have made it into commercial usage.   
> V2K constitutes as War Crimes under the Geneva Conventions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions
       
   
### Consumer V2K     
> A much simpler method to V2K transmission is using invisible headphones available on eBay.    
- A small vibrating earpiece is put against the eardrum, then transmitter can be placed inside something close to the head - like a pillow or mattress, then wirelessly controlled via Bluetooth.

### Sleep Hypnosis     
- Smart applications designed to detect sleeping, then play a series of vocal commands to hypnotise the victim have shown to be extremely effective at providing life changing results.     
> Applications can also be used to wake the user up repeatedly ( sleep deprivation torture )     
- Random Playback of Vocal Commands "quite enough to disguise location, or after someone is determined asleep".   
- Ultrasonic Audio Transmission "Just out of normal audible hearing but enough to vibrate the inner ear bones and cause internal vocal commands to a target, around 20,000 Hz".    
- Subliminal Audio commands in music and video content.   
    
### Video.    
â€¢ Subliminal Imaging ( Image Flickers ) "quick enough not to notice a change in picture"
   
  
### Low Volume Audio Commands   
- Playing low volume audio in the background of a smartphone can also help to induce "Schizophrenia like symptoms"
> ( I can hear voices )      
 
### Magnetic Radiation and Microwave Radiation     
- Microwave radiation has proven to cause memory loss, loss of coordination, brain damage and in large doses "Radiation Poisoning" of a victim unaware of the dangerous surroundings.   
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation has proven effective at treatment of anxiety and depression along with other mental conditions found in mental institutions.        


### Warnings 
> Several security risks surrounding psychology and mental stability are being treated as benign or unlikely scenarios, when in reality they're extremely dangerous in the wrong hands and are actively being used throughout the world to target innocent individuals.   
      
> This project DOES NOT include information on EMF and EMR Exposure, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.
    
  
### Notes,
This application for android to begin with, is planned to contain - sleep detection and sleep hypnosis, sleep deprivation to make a victim stay awake, quite random audio playback and also if I can be bothered, Ultrasonic command playback.   
       
  
### Desired Outcome,
- Technology Induced Schizophrenia Diagnosis   

> Asking family and friends if they can hear voices, the random timer makes it difficult to show anyone what they can hear, or where exactly it came from - eventually a doctor's appointment should be considered and any further treatment will result in side-effects that are likely to cause the desired outcome.    
     
- Most likely diagnosis = Paranoid Schizophrenia,  "I'm hearing voices in my head, I'm having personality changes, etc..."
