### V2K ( Voice to Skull )   
- Ultrasound Voice Transmission to Inner Ear Bones has proven effective at transmitting voice to the skull ( V2K ) at an average of 19500Hz

US Navy conducted several successful studies in 2003 that seem to have made it into commercial usage.   
> V2K constitutes as War Crimes under the Geneva Conventions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions
    
    
### Sleep Hypnosis     
- Smart applications designed to detect sleeping, then play a series of vocal commands to hypnotise the victim have shown to be extremely effective at providing life changing results.     
> Applications can also be used to wake the user up repeatedly ( sleep deprivation torture )     
  

  
### Low Volume Audio Commands   
- Playing low volume audio in the background of a smartphone can also help to induce "Schizophrenia like symptoms"
> ( I can hear voices )   

### Warnings 
> Several security risks surrounding psychology and mental stability are being treated as benign or unlikely scenarios, when in reality they're extremely dangerous in the wrong hands and are actively being used throughout the world to target innocent individuals.

#### Audio.  
- Random Playback of Vocal Commands "quite enough to disguise location, or after someone is determined asleep".   
- Ultrasonic Audio Transmission "Just out of normal audible hearing but enough to vibrate the inner ear bones and cause internal vocal commands to a target, around 20,000 Hz".    
- Subliminal Audio commands in music and video content.   

#### Video.    
â€¢ Subliminal Imaging ( Image Flickers ) "quick enough not to notice a change in picture"
   
  
### Notes,
This application for android to begin with, is planned to contain - sleep detection and sleep hypnosis, sleep deprivation to make a victim stay awake, quite random audio playback and also if I can be bothered, Ultrasonic command playback.   
       
  
### Desired Outcome,
- Technology Induced Schizophrenia Diagnosis   

> Asking family and friends if they can hear voices, the random timer makes it difficult to show anyone what they can hear, or where exactly it came from - eventually a doctor's appointment should be considered and any further treatment will result in side-effects that are likely to cause the desired outcome.    
     
- Most likely diagnosis = Paranoid Schizophrenia,  "I'm hearing voices in my head, I'm having personality changes, etc..."
