# Technology Induced Schizophrenia.    
> Technology Induced and Enhanced Schizophrenia - A Cyber Security Education Initiative.     
     
UPDATED   
- Ultrasound Voice Transmission to Inner Ear Bones has proven effective at transmitting voice to the skull ( V2K ) at an average of 19500Hz

#### Inspired by "Screen Slaver" from "The Incredibles", this is the first application I have developed and are aware of in existence to target people's psychology for adverse health effects.    
    
### Concept   
> Several security risks surrounding psychology and mental stability are being treated as benign or unlikely scenarios, when in reality they're extremely dangerous in the wrong hands and actively being used throughout the world to target innocent individuals.   
      
> This project DOES NOT include information on EMF and EMR Exposure, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.
    
#### Audio.  
• Random Playback of Vocal Commands "quite enough to disguise location".
• Ultrasonic Audio Transmission "Just out of normal audible hearing, but enough to vibrate the inner ear bones and cause internal vocal commands"    

#### Video.    
• Subliminal Imaging ( Image Flickers ) "quick enough not to notice a change in picture"
   
  
#### Hypnosis.   
• To be discussed .....     
      
### OUTCOME.    
Asking family and friends if they can hear voices too, the random timer makes it difficult to show anyone what they can hear, or where exactly it came from - eventually a doctor's appointment should be considered and any further treatment will result in side-effects that are likely to cause the desired outcome.    
     

Most likely diagnosis = Paranoid Schizophrenia,  "I'm hearing voices in my head, etc..."
